🌍 Global Energy Consumption Analysis
This repository contains a detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of global energy consumption data, focusing on trends, dependencies, and environmental impact. The analysis is performed using a Jupyter Notebook.

📊 Project Overview
The main objective of this project is to analyze the various factors contributing to global energy usage, including renewable energy adoption, fossil fuel dependency, and the resulting carbon emissions, across different countries and years.

📁 Repository Contents
Copy of global energy consumed.ipynb: The main Jupyter Notebook containing all the data loading, cleaning, analysis, and visualization steps.
R Studio file : In which visualization part is done .
global energy used.csv: The dataset used for this analysis.

✨ Key Analysis and Features
The notebook performs the following key tasks:

Data Loading and Inspection: Loads the dataset and checks for missing values or duplicates (no duplicates were found).

Feature Engineering: A new feature, Energy Quality Score, is calculated as the difference between the Renewable Energy Share (%) and the Fossil Fuel Dependency (%). This score helps in quickly assessing a country's energy sustainability.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations are generated to understand distributions and relationships between variables like.
